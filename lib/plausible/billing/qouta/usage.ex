    additional usage. This allows us to look at the total usage from pending
    ownerships and owned sites at the same time, which is useful, for example,
    when deciding whether to let the user upgrade to a plan, or accept a site
    ownership.

    usage. Also counts usage from `pending_ownership_site_ids` if that option
