Hey <%= user_salutation(@user) %>,
<br /><br />
Your free 30-day trial is ending <%= @day %>, but you can keep using Plausible by upgrading to a paid plan.
<br /><br />
In the last month, your account has used <%= PlausibleWeb.AuthView.delimit_integer(@pageviews) %> pageviews.
Based on that we recommend you select the <%= suggested_plan_name(@pageviews) %> plan which runs at <%= suggested_plan_cost(@pageviews) %>.
<br /><br />
<%= link("Upgrade now", to: "https://plausible.io/billing/upgrade") %>
<br /><br />
<%= if Plausible.Billing.was_beta_user(@user) do %>
  PS: Since you joined during the beta, you'll get 33% off at checkout.<br /><br />
<% end %>
Have any questions? Just reply to this email to get in touch!
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Thanks,<br />
Uku Taht<br />
